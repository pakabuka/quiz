// Module 3 — Client Confidentiality
const questions = [
  {
    question:
      "Under ABA Model Rule 1.6(a), the GENERAL rule is that a lawyer must not reveal:",
    options: [
      "A. Only privileged communications between lawyer and client",
      "B. Only information the client specifically requested be kept secret",
      "C. Any information relating to the representation of a client",
      "D. Only information that would embarrass or harm the client"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "Rule 1.6 covers all information relating to the representation, regardless of source, privilege status, client request, or potential embarrassment."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Which is NOT an automatic “permission” to disclose under Rule 1.6(a) (before considering 1.6(b) exceptions)?",
    options: [
      "A. The client gives informed consent",
      "B. Disclosure is impliedly authorized to carry out the representation",
      "C. The information came from a third party rather than the client",
      "D. The lawyer reasonably needs to disclose to accomplish the client’s objective (absent contrary instruction)"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "Source does not matter—third-party-sourced facts can still be confidential under Rule 1.6."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Privilege vs. confidentiality: which statement BEST captures the “compulsion vs. gossip” distinction?",
    options: [
      "A. Privilege prevents voluntary disclosure; confidentiality prevents compelled disclosure",
      "B. Privilege prevents compelled disclosure in tribunals; confidentiality prevents voluntary disclosure in all contexts",
      "C. Privilege applies only at cocktail parties; confidentiality applies only in court",
      "D. They are identical doctrines with different names"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Privilege is an evidentiary shield against compelled disclosure; confidentiality is an ethical rule against voluntary disclosure in any setting (even where privilege doesn’t apply)."
  },

  {
    question:
      "During trial, opposing counsel subpoenas Lawyer L and asks about confidential lawyer-client communications. Which doctrine MOST directly governs whether L must answer?",
    options: [
      "A. Rule 1.6 (ethical confidentiality) only",
      "B. Attorney-client privilege (evidence law)",
      "C. Work product immunity only",
      "D. Rule 8.3 (reporting) only"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "When a tribunal compels testimony, privilege is the primary doctrine governing compulsion (though ethics may also require asserting privilege)."
  },

  {
    question:
      "At a cocktail party, someone asks Lawyer L about a client matter. Privilege is irrelevant because there is no compulsion. Which rule controls L’s ability to share?",
    options: [
      "A. Attorney-client privilege",
      "B. Rule 1.6 (ethical duty of confidentiality)",
      "C. Work product immunity",
      "D. Rule 3.3 (candor to tribunal)"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Privilege doesn’t apply outside compulsion contexts, but Rule 1.6 still forbids voluntary disclosure of information relating to representation."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Kinds of information covered: which statement is MOST accurate?",
    options: [
      "A. Privilege covers all information relating to representation; confidentiality covers only communications",
      "B. Privilege covers confidential communications; confidentiality covers communications PLUS other information relating to representation from any source",
      "C. Privilege and confidentiality cover only information the client marks 'confidential'",
      "D. Privilege covers third-party facts; confidentiality does not"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Privilege is narrower (communications); confidentiality is broader (all information relating to representation, regardless of source)."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Lawyer A learns from a third party (not from the client) an embarrassing fact about Client C that is relevant to the representation. Which is MOST accurate?",
    options: [
      "A. It is not covered by either privilege or confidentiality because the client didn’t say it",
      "B. It is privileged but not confidential",
      "C. It may not be privileged, but it is still confidential under Rule 1.6",
      "D. It is neither privileged nor confidential if it would embarrass the client"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "Third-party-sourced facts are typically not privileged communications, but they still fall within Rule 1.6 if they relate to the representation."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Disclosure vs. use: which is MOST accurate about confidentiality compared to privilege?",
    options: [
      "A. Both doctrines concern only compelled disclosure, not use",
      "B. Privilege concerns disclosure; confidentiality concerns both disclosure and use (including use to the client’s disadvantage)",
      "C. Privilege concerns use; confidentiality concerns disclosure only",
      "D. Confidentiality permits using information to a former client’s disadvantage"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Privilege is about compelled disclosure. Ethics rules also restrict using confidential information to the disadvantage of clients/former/prospective clients without consent (e.g., 1.8(b), 1.9(c), 1.18(b))."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Attorney-client privilege BASIC rule: privilege prevents a tribunal from compelling disclosure of:",
    options: [
      "A. Any fact the lawyer knows about the client",
      "B. Confidential communications between attorney (or agent) and client (or agent) concerning the professional relationship",
      "C. Any documents the client gives the lawyer",
      "D. Only communications made after a fee agreement is signed"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Privilege protects confidential communications about legal services between lawyer/client (and their agents)."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Prospective client communications: H consults Lawyer L in confidence about divorce but never hires L. Which is MOST accurate?",
    options: [
      "A. No privilege because no attorney-client relationship formed",
      "B. Privilege still applies to preliminary communications seeking legal services",
      "C. Privilege applies only if L later appears in court",
      "D. Only Rule 1.6 applies; privilege never applies pre-engagement"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Privilege can cover preliminary communications made for the purpose of obtaining legal services, even if no representation follows."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Corporate client privilege (Upjohn-type rule): which employee communication is MOST clearly privileged?",
    options: [
      "A. An employee voluntarily chats with counsel at a bar about office gossip",
      "B. An employee communicates with counsel at a superior’s direction, knowing the purpose is to obtain legal advice for the corporation, about matters within the employee’s duties",
      "C. Any employee communication to counsel, about anything, anytime",
      "D. Only communications from the CEO and general counsel"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Privilege can cover communications with non-high-ranking employees when they meet the direction/knowledge/scope-of-duties conditions."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Who counts as an 'attorney' for privilege purposes?",
    options: [
      "A. Anyone giving business advice who has a JD",
      "B. A person authorized to practice law (or reasonably believed to be), acting as an attorney rather than as a friend/business advisor",
      "C. Only lawyers licensed in the client’s state",
      "D. Only lawyers who have signed a retainer agreement"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Privilege requires a lawyer (or someone reasonably believed to be one) acting in a legal capacity."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Privilege covers communications to/from agents. Which is the BEST example?",
    options: [
      "A. Lawyer hires an engineer to help on technical litigation; engineer interviews the client’s employee at lawyer’s direction about case facts",
      "B. Lawyer’s friend overhears a phone call by accident",
      "C. Client posts details on social media",
      "D. Opposing counsel emails the client directly"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation:
      "Communications through necessary agents assisting the legal representation can be privileged."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Mechanical details: which is MOST accurate?",
    options: [
      "A. Client identity and fee arrangements are always privileged",
      "B. Mechanical details are usually not privileged, but can be privileged if revealing them is tantamount to revealing a privileged communication",
      "C. Mechanical details are never discoverable once the lawyer has them",
      "D. Mechanical details are privileged only in criminal cases"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Normally not privileged, but may become privileged when disclosure effectively reveals the confidential legal communication."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Hit-and-run example: Client X tells Lawyer L in confidence, “I’m the hit-and-run driver,” and asks L not to reveal identity. Plaintiffs subpoena L for X’s identity. Most accurate?",
    options: [
      "A. L must disclose identity because identity is always non-privileged",
      "B. L may refuse because identity is privileged here (disclosing it is tantamount to revealing the privileged admission)",
      "C. L must disclose unless paid by the plaintiffs",
      "D. L must disclose only if the case is civil (not criminal)"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Even normally non-privileged mechanical details can be privileged where disclosure would effectively reveal the confidential communication."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Preexisting documents: Client hands lawyer a preexisting contract file that would be discoverable if held by the client. What happens to discoverability?",
    options: [
      "A. It becomes privileged because it’s now in the lawyer’s file",
      "B. It remains discoverable; privilege does not shield preexisting documents merely by transfer to counsel",
      "C. It becomes work product automatically",
      "D. It becomes confidential under privilege but not under Rule 1.6"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:

    question:
      "Physical evidence: Client tells Lawyer, “I threw the gun in the trash behind my apartment.” Which is MOST accurate?",
    options: [
      "A. The gun is privileged, so the prosecution can’t get it",
      "B. The communication about the gun’s location is privileged; the gun itself is not privileged",
      "C. Neither the communication nor the gun is privileged",
      "D. The lawyer must immediately retrieve and destroy the gun"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Physical evidence isn’t privileged, but the client’s confidential statement to the lawyer can be."
  },

  {
    question:
      "If the lawyer retrieves the gun from the trash to examine it, what is MOST accurate under the outline’s Meredith/Olwell compromise?",
    options: [
      "A. Lawyer may keep it forever if it helps the defense",
      "B. Lawyer must turn it over to authorities after obtaining useful info; if the jury hears where it was found, they should not be told the lawyer was the source",
      "C. Lawyer must hide it to protect privilege",
      "D. Lawyer must disclose the client’s statement to the jury"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Retrieval triggers duties: don’t destroy/hide; may examine briefly; then turn over. Location can come in without identifying lawyer as source (per the compromise described)."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Confidentiality for privilege purposes: a communication is “confidential” if:",
    options: [
      "A. The client later regrets saying it",
      "B. It was made by means not intended to disclose to outsiders and the communicator reasonably believed no outsider would hear it",

      "D. The lawyer labeled it confidential in notes"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Privilege requires a reasonable expectation of privacy in the manner of communication."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Attorney and Client discuss trial strategy in a crowded courthouse corridor where bystanders can obviously overhear. For privilege purposes, this is:",
    options: [
      "A. Confidential because it involved legal advice",
      "B. Not confidential, so privilege likely does not apply",
      "C. Confidential because the lawyer spoke quietly",
      "D. Privileged unless an eavesdropper testifies"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "No reasonable expectation of privacy → not “confidential” → privilege fails (even though ethics duties may still apply)."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Presence of third parties: which statement is MOST accurate for privilege?",
    options: [
      "A. Any third party destroys privilege automatically",
      "B. Third parties do not destroy confidentiality if present to further the attorney-client relationship (including some psychological-support presence)",
      "C. Only accountants can be present without waiver",
      "D. Third parties never matter"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Third parties who facilitate the representation (or sometimes are present for client needs) do not necessarily destroy confidentiality."

      "A. The lawyer",
      "B. The court",

      "D. Opposing counsel"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:

  },

  {
    question:
      "Waiver: Client shows a neighbor the first two pages of a three-page privileged letter. Later, opposing party seeks the whole letter. Most accurate?",
    options: [
      "A. No waiver because only two pages were shown",
      "B. Waiver likely extends to the entire communication (the whole letter)",
      "C. Waiver applies only if the neighbor signs an affidavit",
      "D. No waiver unless the client intended to waive"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Revealing a significant portion of a privileged communication can waive the privilege as to the whole communication."
  },

  {
    question:
      "At-issue waiver: Defendant appeals a conviction claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. Most accurate about privilege?",
    options: [
      "A. Privilege remains absolute; counsel cannot disclose anything",
      "B. Defendant puts legal services at issue, waiving privilege as to relevant communications",
      "C. Only the prosecutor can waive privilege",
      "D. Privilege is waived only if the defendant testifies"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:

    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "If the client hasn’t waived, the lawyer must assert privilege when someone seeks privileged info and the client isn’t present."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Duration: which statement is MOST accurate?",
    options: [
      "A. Privilege ends when the lawyer-client relationship ends",

    question:
      "Related doctrine: work product immunity generally protects:",
    options: [
      "A. All client documents in the lawyer’s possession",
      "B. Litigation/anticipated-litigation materials, unless opponent shows substantial need and undue hardship; and mental impressions are especially protected",
      "C. Only privileged communications",
      "D. Only materials filed in court"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Work product covers litigation preparation materials; opinion work product (mental impressions) gets heightened protection."
  },

  {

      "D. The exception applies only if the client is convicted"

    options: [
      "A. Lawyers are strictly liable for any data breach, regardless of precautions",

      "B. No—Rule 1.6 can still apply unless the information becomes generally known",

      "D. No—because Rule 1.6 applies only to privileged communications"
