// Module 2 — Client-Lawyer Relationship
const questions = [
  {
    question:
      "Which statement BEST describes the legal nature of the client-lawyer relationship in this module?",
    options: [
      "A. It is purely fiduciary and not contractual, so parties cannot vary its terms",
      "B. It is contractual, and many terms are implied by custom but can generally be varied by mutual agreement",
      "C. It is a tort-based relationship that arises only upon malpractice or negligence",
      "D. It is created only by a signed writing and court filing"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "The relationship is contractual, with many implied terms, but generally modifiable by mutual agreement—subject to fiduciary fairness scrutiny and ethics limits."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Because a lawyer is a fiduciary to the client, which consequence is MOST accurate under this module?",
    options: [
      "A. The contract is construed against the client because the client has superior knowledge",
      "B. The contract is construed against the lawyer and closely scrutinized for fairness",
      "C. The contract is unenforceable unless notarized",
      "D. The lawyer owes no agency duties once fees are paid"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Fiduciary status triggers close scrutiny for fairness and construction against the lawyer, who typically has superior expertise and drafting power."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Under Restatement §14, a lawyer-client relationship arises in which situation?",
    options: [
      "A. A person hopes a lawyer will help and tells a friend about it",
      "B. A person manifests intent that the lawyer provide legal services and the lawyer agrees",
      "C. A person reads a lawyer’s website and feels reassured",
      "D. A person leaves a voicemail and receives no response"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Formation requires (i) client’s manifested intent + lawyer’s agreement; or (ii) client’s manifested intent + lawyer’s failure to clearly decline when the lawyer knows/should know of reasonable reliance; or (iii) tribunal appointment."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Implied assent / reasonable reliance: Carla sends Attorney Aida a letter asking for representation. Aida never responds. A year later the statute runs. Which is MOST accurate?",
    options: [
      "A. An attorney-client relationship existed because silence is acceptance",
      "B. No relationship existed because Carla’s reliance on an unanswered letter was unreasonable",
      "C. A relationship existed only if Carla enclosed a retainer check",
      "D. A relationship existed only if Aida had handled Carla’s matters before"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "The module’s example treats reliance on an unanswered letter as unreasonable; no attorney-client relationship formed on those facts."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Casey calls Lawyer Lisa’s office 10 days before court and asks Lisa to represent him. The secretary says, “Send the papers,” but does NOT clarify that Lisa hasn’t agreed and will decide later. Lisa declines only 1 day before court. Which is MOST accurate?",
    options: [
      "A. No relationship because only Lisa (not staff) can create it",
      "B. No relationship because Casey never met Lisa in person",
      "C. A relationship likely existed because reliance was reasonable given the office’s response and the imminent hearing",
      "D. A relationship exists only if Lisa files an appearance"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "A lawyer’s assent can be implied when the lawyer (or agent) fails to clearly decline and the prospective client reasonably relies—especially with imminent deadlines."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Which BEST states the rule for implied assent under Restatement §14(ii)?",
    options: [
      "A. If a person asks for help, representation automatically begins",
      "B. A lawyer’s silence always equals assent",
      "C. A relationship arises if the lawyer fails to make clear they do not undertake representation and the lawyer knows/should know the person is reasonably relying",
      "D. A relationship arises only if the lawyer receives confidential information"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "The key is failure to clearly decline + lawyer’s knowledge (or should-know) of the prospective client’s reasonable reliance."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Which is a THIRD way a lawyer-client relationship can be formed under Restatement §14?",
    options: [
      "A. The client posts about hiring the lawyer on social media",
      "B. A tribunal appoints the lawyer to represent the client",
      "C. The lawyer sends marketing materials to the client",
      "D. The lawyer offers a free consultation on a website"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Tribunal appointment independently forms the relationship, even without the usual mutual assent dynamics."
  },

  {
    question:
      "United States vs. English barrister lore: which is MOST accurate in this module?",
    options: [
      "A. U.S. lawyers generally must accept any case if offered a proper fee",
      "B. U.S. lawyers are generally free to refuse service to any person for any reason (subject to specific ethics limits)",
      "C. U.S. lawyers must accept all indigent clients",
      "D. U.S. lawyers must accept any case referred by another lawyer"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "The module contrasts the (lore) cab-rank idea with U.S. practice: U.S. lawyers generally may refuse representation, though they must refuse in certain prohibited situations."
  },

  {
    question:
      "A prospective client admits: “I don’t care if I win; I just want to embarrass and burden my ex-business partner.” What must the lawyer do?",
    options: [
      "A. Accept if the client can pay up front",
      "B. Accept but warn the client not to say that again",
      "C. Refuse because taking steps where the client’s motive is to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person violates Rule 4.4(a)",
      "D. Accept if the lawyer files a complaint quickly"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "Rule 4.4(a) forbids using legal steps with the improper purpose of embarrassing/delaying/burdening a third person; the lawyer must reject such a case."
  },

  {
    question:
      "A civil plaintiff wants to sue on a claim with no evidentiary support and no good-faith basis to change existing law. Under Rule 3.1, the lawyer must:",
    options: [
      "A. File anyway if the client insists",
      "B. Decline because the position is frivolous",
      "C. File but label it “for settlement leverage only”",
      "D. File if the lawyer discloses the weakness to opposing counsel"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Rule 3.1 prohibits taking frivolous factual or legal positions. Good-faith arguments for extension/modification of law can be nonfrivolous; this scenario lacks that."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Which statement BEST reflects the module’s nuance about “frivolous” positions under Rule 3.1?",
    options: [
      "A. A claim is frivolous unless the lawyer already has all facts in hand at intake",
      "B. A claim is not frivolous if the lawyer expects to develop missing facts through discovery and has a good-faith basis for the theory",
      "C. A claim is nonfrivolous whenever the client is emotionally invested",
      "D. A claim is frivolous whenever the lawyer estimates a low chance of success"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "The module emphasizes discovery can supply facts; the key is good faith and a nonfrivolous basis in fact/law or good-faith law-change argument."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Criminal defense exception: which is MOST accurate under Rule 3.1 as described?",
    options: [
      "A. Criminal defense counsel may never raise defenses lacking evidentiary support",
      "B. Criminal defense counsel may defend to the extent allowed by constitutional law even if the defense would otherwise violate Rule 3.1",
      "C. Criminal cases have no ethics rules because defendants have rights",
      "D. Only prosecutors are bound by Rule 3.1"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "The module notes an important caveat: criminal defense has constitutional overlays that may allow certain defenses/positions beyond the usual Rule 3.1 baseline."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Lawyer L is too busy to prepare competently for a complex trial but accepts anyway. Under this module, what rule is MOST directly implicated at intake?",
    options: [
      "A. Rule 1.1 (competence)",
      "B. Rule 8.3 (reporting)",
      "C. Rule 5.4(c) (independence)",
      "D. Rule 7.2 (advertising)"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation:
      "A lawyer must reject a case if too busy or too inexperienced to handle it competently—Rule 1.1."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Lawyer L’s personal feelings about a client’s cause are so strong that L cannot effectively represent the client. Under the module, L must:",
    options: [
      "A. Accept if L promises to stay professional",
      "B. Refuse (or withdraw) because strong personal feelings can create a material limitation conflict / inability to represent effectively",
      "C. Accept only if the client signs an “I understand you disagree” waiver",
      "D. Accept because clients control objectives"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "If personal feelings materially impair representation, the lawyer must refuse/withdraw (linked in the module to Rule 1.16(a)(1) and 1.7(a)(2))."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Lawyer L’s mental condition materially impairs L’s ability to represent a client. Which is MOST accurate?",
    options: [
      "A. L may continue as long as the client consents",
      "B. L must decline or withdraw under Rule 1.16(a)(2)",
      "C. L must continue if a court case is already filed",
      "D. L may continue if another lawyer “checks” L’s work occasionally"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Material impairment triggers mandatory decline/withdrawal under Rule 1.16(a)(2), regardless of client consent."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Prospective client duties: A person consults Lawyer L about a possible representation, but no relationship forms. Under Restatement §15, L still must:",
    options: [
      "A. Represent the person in any related matter for free",
      "B. Protect the person’s confidential information, safeguard any property given, and use reasonable care in any advice provided",
      "C. Report the person’s wrongdoing to authorities",
      "D. File a lawsuit to preserve the statute of limitations"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "The module lists three core duties to prospective clients: confidentiality/conflicts protection, property protection, and reasonable-care legal advice."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Prospective client conflicts: Lawyer L learns harmful confidential information from Prospective Client P in a consult. Later, Opponent O asks L to represent O in the same matter. Under the module, L should:",
    options: [
      "A. Take O because no lawyer-client relationship existed with P",
      "B. Take O if L charges O a higher fee for the risk",
      "C. Decline if P’s confidential info could be harmful to P in the same/related matter",
      "D. Take O if L promises not to “use” what was learned"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "Even without a formed relationship, prospective client confidentiality can bar representing an adverse party in the same/related matter if the info could be significantly harmful."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Ethical obligation to accept unpopular cases (Rule 6.2 comment): which is MOST accurate under this module?",
    options: [
      "A. Lawyers must accept every unpopular client who requests help",
      "B. Lawyers should help make legal services available, including by accepting a fair share of unpopular/indigent matters",
      "C. Lawyers must accept only unpopular matters and may refuse ordinary paying clients",
      "D. The obligation applies only to public defenders"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "The module frames this as an ethical aspiration: help make services available, e.g., accept a fair share of unpopular/indigent matters."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Fee communication (Rule 1.5(b)): which is MOST accurate?",
    options: [
      "A. A writing is always required for every fee agreement",
      "B. The lawyer must communicate the basis/rate of the fee and expenses before or within a reasonable time after commencing representation, and must communicate changes",
      "C. The lawyer may keep fees vague as long as they are “fair”",
      "D. Fee communication is required only if the client asks"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Rule 1.5(b) requires timely communication of fee basis/rate and expenses, and ongoing communication about changes; writing is preferred but not generally required (except contingent fees)."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Regularly represented client exception: Lawyer L has represented Client C for years at the same hourly rate. For a new routine matter at the same rate, L must:",
    options: [
      "A. Re-communicate the fee basis every time without exception",
      "B. Not necessarily re-communicate if the basis/rate is the same as in other matters",
      "C. Get a signed writing each time",
      "D. Charge a lower rate automatically"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "If the lawyer regularly represents the client and charges the same basis/rate, re-communication each time is not required."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Which response is a DISCIPLINARY VIOLATION under Rule 1.5(b) as described?",
    options: [
      'A. “My fee is $175/hour; I estimate ~100 hours, but it could vary.”',
      'B. “I cannot predict exactly; here is my hourly rate and how costs work.”',
      'C. “Impossible to tell. Don’t worry—I assure you it’ll be fair.”',
      "D. “Here’s the rate; if complexity increases, I’ll update you promptly.”"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "The module’s example flags vague assurances of “fairness” without communicating the basis/rate as a Rule 1.5(b) violation."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Unreasonable fee discipline (Rule 1.5(a)): which statement is MOST accurate?",
    options: [
      "A. Courts always enforce the fee contract if the client signed it",
      "B. A lawyer may charge any fee as long as it matches local custom",
      "C. A lawyer is subject to discipline for trying to exact an unreasonable fee or unreasonable expenses",
      "D. Only contingent fees are reviewed for reasonableness"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "Rule 1.5(a) bars unreasonable fees/expenses; courts may refuse enforcement and discipline may follow."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Which is NOT one of the Rule 1.5(a) reasonableness factors listed in the module?",
    options: [
      "A. Time and labor required",
      "B. Novelty and difficulty of the questions",
      "C. Lawyer’s political connections",
      "D. Amount at stake and results obtained"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "Political connections are irrelevant. The module lists the standard 1.5(a) factors (time/labor, difficulty, skill, preclusion, custom, stake/results, time limits, relationship, experience/reputation/ability, fixed vs contingent)."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Billing: which is MOST accurate under this module’s overhead rule?",
    options: [
      "A. A lawyer may charge clients for ordinary office overhead (rent, normal staff salaries) as itemized expenses",
      "B. A lawyer must not charge clients for ordinary overhead, but may charge actual costs of special services (or a reasonable amount agreed in advance)",
      "C. A lawyer may mark up third-party charges as a profit center",
      "D. A lawyer may always bill a flat “office operations fee” without disclosure"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Ordinary overhead isn’t billable as an expense; special services may be charged at actual cost (or reasonable agreed amount). Third-party services generally may not be marked up beyond actual cost."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Double billing: Lawyer spends 3 hours working on Client A’s case while flying to take depositions for Client B. Under the module, Lawyer may:",
    options: [
      "A. Bill both A and B for the full 3 hours",
      "B. Bill neither A nor B because travel time cancels work time",
      "C. Bill either A or B for the full 3 hours, or apportion—BUT not bill both for the same 3 hours",
      "D. Bill A for 3 hours and B for 3 hours if disclosed after the fact"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "The module forbids double billing the same time. The lawyer can bill one client, or apportion the time, but not bill both for the full block."
  },

  {
    question:
      "Third-party vendor charges: Lawyer pays a court reporter $500 and bills the client $700 “for handling.” Under the module, this is:",
    options: [
      "A. Proper if the client is wealthy",
      "B. Proper if the client signed a general engagement letter",
