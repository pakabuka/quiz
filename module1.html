    const questions = [
      {
        question: "Which statement BEST describes the primary source of authority for regulating lawyers within a state?",
        options: [
          "A. The state legislature has ultimate authority because ethics rules are statutes",
          "B. The state’s highest court has ultimate authority because regulation of lawyers is an inherent judicial power",
          "C. The state bar association has ultimate authority because it administers discipline",
          "D. The ABA has ultimate authority because most states adopt the Model Rules"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation:
          "The ultimate regulatory power generally rests with the state’s highest court, which has inherent power to regulate the legal profession and typically promulgates ethics rules and oversees discipline. Legislatures and bar associations play roles, but they are not the ultimate source of authority."
      },

      {
        question: "In a state with an “integrated” bar, which of the following is TRUE?",
        options: [
          "A. Lawyers must join the ABA to practice in the state",
          "B. Lawyers must be members of the state bar association to be admitted/maintain membership, and the bar often helps administer regulation and discipline",
          "C. The bar association, not the courts, promulgates binding ethics rules",
          "D. Integrated bars exist only in federal courts"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation:
          "An integrated bar means membership in the state bar is mandatory for lawyers admitted in that state. Bars commonly administer exams/CLE and assist courts with regulation/discipline, but the state’s highest court generally remains the ultimate authority."
      },

      {
        question: "Federal government attorney G practices in State X. Under 28 U.S.C. § 530B(a) (and related regulations), which is MOST accurate?",
        options: [
          "A. G is exempt from State X’s ethics rules because federal employment preempts state regulation",
          "B. G is subject to State X’s ethics rules that prescribe ethical conduct and could lead to professional discipline",
          "C. G is subject only to State X’s evidence rules and civil procedure rules",
          "D. G is subject only to the ABA Model Rules, not State X’s rules"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation:
          "Federal government attorneys must comply with state laws and rules governing attorneys in each state where they engage in their duties. Federal regulations interpret this as applying to ethics rules that prescribe conduct and may subject an attorney to discipline—not general state evidence/procedure/substantive law."
      },

      {
        question: "Lawyer L is admitted in State A and State B. L commits misconduct while physically present in State C, where L is not admitted. Which is MOST accurate regarding disciplinary authority?",
        options: [
          "A. Only State C may discipline L because the conduct occurred there",
          "B. Only State A may discipline L because that was L’s first admission",
          "C. Both State A and State B may discipline L regardless of where the conduct occurred",
          "D. No state may discipline L unless L is admitted in the state where the conduct occurred"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation:
          "A lawyer is subject to regulation by each state in which the lawyer is admitted, regardless of where the lawyer actually practices or where the conduct occurred (Model Rule 8.5(a))."
      },

      {
        question: "Bar applicant A intentionally omits that A was suspended from college for cheating. The omission is discovered after A is admitted. The BEST answer is:",
        options: [
          "A. No issue—admission ends the committee’s power",
          "B. A is subject to discipline because knowingly making a false statement of material fact in connection with admission violates Rule 8.1(a)",
          "C. A cannot be disciplined unless the underlying cheating is a felony",
          "D. A is protected because character and fitness is purely subjective"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation:
          "Rule 8.1(a) prohibits knowingly making a false statement of material fact in connection with a bar admission application. Concealment of a serious honesty issue can support denial and also discipline if discovered after admission."
      },

      {
        question: "Attorney T is helping friend F apply to the bar. T learns (outside any attorney-client relationship) that F used a forged law school graduation certificate and the bar has not discovered it. What must T do?",
        options: [
          "A. Nothing—reporting is never required in the admissions context",
          "B. Report only if the forgery would be a felony in the state",
          "C. Tell the admissions authority because Rule 8.1(b) prohibits failing to disclose a fact necessary to correct a known misapprehension",
          "D. Keep silent because confidentiality always applies to discussions with friends"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation:
          "Rule 8.1(b) requires disclosure to correct a known misapprehension or respond to a lawful demand for information—unless the information is protected by confidentiality rules. Here, T’s knowledge is not from a protected attorney-client/prospective-client consultation, so T must disclose."
      },

      {
        question: "Same facts as the prior question, except F consulted T as a lawyer for legal advice about the forged certificate, and T learned the facts in that consultation. What is MOST accurate?",
        options: [
          "A. T must still report because bar admissions is more important than confidentiality",
          "B. T must not report because Rule 8.1 does not require disclosure of information protected by confidentiality rules",
          "C. T must report only if the forgery is ongoing",
          "D. T may report only if F is a close friend"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation:
          "Rule 8.1’s duties do not require disclosure of information protected by confidentiality. If T learned it in a lawyer-client/prospective-client context, confidentiality generally bars disclosure absent a specific Rule 1.6 exception."
      },

      {
        question: "Which requirement is constitutionally INVALID as a condition of admission to a state bar?",
        options: [
          "A. Requiring an applicant to take an oath to support the U.S. and state constitutions",
          "B. Requiring U.S. citizenship as a condition of bar admission",
          "C. Requiring graduation from an accredited law school",
          "D. Requiring passage of a bar examination"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation:
          "A state cannot require U.S. citizenship for bar admission (Equal Protection). By contrast, requiring an oath, education, and passing the bar are generally permissible."
      },

      {
        question: "Applicant P is denied admission for lack of “good moral character.” Which procedural protection is P MOST clearly entitled to in the admissions process?",
        options: [
          "A. No process rights because admission is a privilege, not a right",
          "B. Due process protections such as notice of charges and an opportunity to respond, including confronting critics",
          "C. A jury trial because character determinations are criminal in nature",
          "D. Absolute confidentiality preventing P from learning the evidence against them"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation:
          "Bar applicants are entitled to due process in committee proceedings (notice of charges, opportunity to explain/contest derogatory info, and judicial review). It is not a criminal trial, but basic due process applies."
      },

      {
        question: "Which is the BEST statement about crimes and professional discipline under Rule 8.4(b)?",
        options: [
          "A. Any crime automatically triggers discipline",
          "B. Only crimes committed in the course of representing a client can trigger discipline",
          "C. A criminal act subjects a lawyer to discipline if it reflects adversely on honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects",
          "D. Only felonies involving violence trigger discipline"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation:
          "Rule 8.4(b) focuses on whether the criminal act reflects adversely on honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness. Some crimes (dishonesty, breach of trust, violence, interference with justice) are classic triggers; others (e.g., isolated DUI in many jurisdictions) may not."
      },

      {
        question: "Lawyer L is caught plagiarizing substantial portions of a brief filed in court. Under the Model Rules, the MOST direct basis for professional misconduct is:",
        options: [
          "A. Rule 8.4(c) (dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation)",
          "B. Rule 8.4(d) only (conduct prejudicial to administration of justice), and nothing else",
          "C. Rule 8.4(e) (improper influence) because plagiarism “influences” the judge",
          "D. No misconduct unless L is convicted of a crime"
        ],
        correct: 0,
        explanation:
          "Plagiarism commonly falls under dishonesty/misrepresentation (Rule 8.4(c)) and can also implicate other rules. It need not be criminal to be professional misconduct."
      },

      {
        question: "Attorney A tells a client: “Don’t worry, I have special pull with the agency—my connections will make them approve this even if the law doesn’t.” Which rule is MOST directly implicated?",
        options: [
          "A. Rule 8.4(e) (stating or implying ability to improperly influence an official or achieve results by improper means)",
          "B. Rule 5.6(a) (restriction on right to practice)",
          "C. Rule 5.7 (law-related services)",
          "D. Rule 8.3 (duty to report)"
        ],
        correct: 0,
        explanation:
          "Rule 8.4(e) prohibits stating or implying an ability to improperly influence officials or achieve results by violating law/ethics."
      },

      {
        question: "Lawyer L learns that opposing counsel O has been padding billing records and forging client signatures on settlement checks. L has credible proof. L is not O’s lawyer and learned this outside any confidential relationship. What is L’s duty?",
        options: [
          "A. Must report because this raises a substantial question as to honesty/fitness",
          "B. May report but has no duty because billing is “private” conduct",
          "C. Must confront O but may not report to authorities",
          "D. Must report only if a judge orders it"
        ],
        correct: 0,
        explanation:
          "Rule 8.3(a) requires reporting known misconduct that raises a substantial question as to a lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness. Forgery and theft-like dishonesty are classic triggers."
      },

      {
        question: "Which is the BEST description of the knowledge requirement in the duty-to-report rule (Rule 8.3)?",
        options: [
          "A. Suspicion triggers a mandatory report",
          "B. “Knowledge” means actual knowledge, though it may be inferred from circumstances; it is more than mere suspicion",
          "C. Knowledge means “should have known” (negligence standard) for all lawyers",
          "D. Anonymous rumors always equal knowledge"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation:
          "Rule 8.3 uses an actual-knowledge standard (though knowledge can be inferred). Mere suspicion doesn’t trigger a mandatory report (though voluntary reporting may be allowed)."
      },

      {
        question: "Lawyer M serves as a volunteer in an approved lawyers’ assistance program (LAP). During a LAP meeting, Lawyer N admits to serious ongoing trust-account theft. Under Rule 8.3(c), which is MOST accurate?",
        options: [
          "A. M must report because trust-account theft always triggers reporting",
          "B. M has no duty to report information learned in the course of an approved LAP program",
          "C. M must report unless N signs a waiver",
          "D. M must report only to the LAP director, not to authorities"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation:
          "Rule 8.3(c) creates an exception: no duty to disclose information learned while serving as a member of an approved lawyers’ assistance program."
      },

      {
        question: "In a lawyer disciplinary hearing, which statement is MOST accurate about constitutional protections?",
        options: [
          "A. The exclusionary rule applies, so illegally seized evidence is always inadmissible",
          "B. The lawyer may invoke the Fifth Amendment, and discipline cannot be based solely on invoking it",
          "C. The lawyer has no due process rights because the proceeding is “administrative”",
          "D. The burden of proof is always “beyond a reasonable doubt”"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation:
          "The exclusionary rule generally does not apply in lawyer discipline. The lawyer may assert the Fifth Amendment, and discipline cannot be imposed solely because of that assertion. Due process applies, but the burden of proof is typically above preponderance and below beyond a reasonable doubt (varies by jurisdiction)."
      },

      {
        question: "During a disciplinary hearing, the committee adds a new charge mid-hearing that was not in the original complaint, and sanctions L based on that new theory. Which principle is MOST implicated?",
        options: [
          "A. The disciplinary authority may always amend charges without notice",
          "B. Procedural due process requires that the hearing be limited to the charges made in the complaint (Ruffalo principle)",
          "C. The committee must refer all new charges to the ABA",
          "D. Lawyers have no right to counsel in disciplinary hearings"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation:
          "Procedural due process requires notice and a fair opportunity to defend; disciplinary proceedings should be limited to charges in the complaint. Adding new charges midstream without notice is a classic due process problem."
      },

      {
        question: "Choice of law: Lawyer L is litigating a case pending in State Y’s courts. L’s conduct (e.g., communications with the tribunal) occurs while L is physically in State X. Which rules generally apply?",
        options: [
          "A. State X’s rules because that’s where the conduct occurred",
          "B. State Y’s rules because the conduct is in connection with a matter pending before a tribunal in State Y (unless the tribunal’s rules provide otherwise)",
          "C. The ABA Model Rules always control in tribunal matters",
          "D. Whichever rules are more favorable to L"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation:
          "Under Rule 8.5(b), if conduct is in connection with a matter pending before a tribunal, the rules of the jurisdiction where the tribunal sits generally apply (unless the tribunal’s rules provide otherwise)."
      },

      {
        question: "Choice of law (non-tribunal conduct): Lawyer L in State A emails advice to a client whose deal is centered in State B; the advice’s primary impact is in State B. The states’ rules conflict. Which is MOST accurate?",
        options: [
          "A. State A’s rules always apply because L was physically in State A",
          "B. State B’s rules apply if the predominant effect is in State B",
          "C. No state’s rules apply because it was “just an email”",
          "D. The client may pick which state’s rules apply after a dispute arises"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation:
          "For other conduct, Rule 8.5(b) applies the rules where the conduct occurred, but if the predominant effect is in another jurisdiction, that jurisdiction’s rules apply."
      },

      {
        question: "Safe harbor: Two states’ rules conflict. Lawyer L reasonably believes the predominant effect of L’s conduct will occur in State B and L complies with State B’s rule. Which is MOST accurate?",
        options: [
          "A. L is still disciplined if State A later claims its rules should have applied",
          "B. L will not be subject to discipline if the conduct is proper in the jurisdiction where L reasonably believes the predominant effect will occur",
          "C. Safe harbor applies only if L obtains a written opinion from State B’s bar counsel",
          "D. Safe harbor applies only to advertising rules"
