      "D. Services only in the lawyer’s favorite practice area"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:

      "D. No, but only in criminal cases"

    question:
      "Example: lawyer misses a statute of limitations because of a family emergency. Most accurate discipline analysis:",
    options: [

      "D. Malpractice is automatic whenever there’s an ethics complaint"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Malpractice is private civil liability focused on compensating the injured party, not bar discipline."
  },
  {
    question:
      "Does an ethics violation automatically (or presumptively) establish malpractice?",
    options: [
      "A. Yes, automatically",
      "B. Yes, it creates a presumption",

    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "Model Rules scope: not designed as a basis for civil liability. But courts may treat violations as evidence of negligence."

  {
    question:
      "Duty to clients: when is it easiest for courts to find an attorney-client relationship existed?",
    options: [
      "A. Only when a written retainer exists",
      "B. When the lawyer’s conduct/neglect misled the would-be client into thinking representation existed",
      "C. Only after the first court appearance",
      "D. Only when fees are fully paid"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Courts may find the relationship if the lawyer’s neglect misled the alleged client, especially where reliance caused harm."
  },
  {
    question:
      "Example: lawyer says she’ll check conflicts and “get back to you,” then forgets and SOL runs. Likely duty analysis?",
    options: [
      "A. No duty because no contract was signed",
      "B. Court could find an attorney-client relationship formed (duty owed) based on the lawyer’s conduct and the client’s reliance",
      "C. No duty because the lawyer never billed",
      "D. No duty because it was only a consultation"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Neglect + assurances can create a relationship and duty (especially if the client is misled)."
  },
  {
    question:
      "Duty to prospective clients: if a lawyer provides legal services during a consultation, the lawyer must:",
    options: [
      "A. Use reasonable care",
      "B. Use no care because they aren’t hired yet",
      "C. Guarantee correct advice",
      "D. Avoid answering any question"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation:
      "A lawyer can owe a duty of reasonable care in advice given during a consultation."
  },
  {
    question:
      "Duty to nonclients: a lawyer may owe a duty of due care to a third party when:",
    options: [

      "B. The third party was intended to benefit from the lawyer’s services OR the lawyer invited the third party to rely on the lawyer’s work",
      "C. The third party is a friend of the client",
      "D. The third party reads about the lawyer online"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Restatement-style approach: intended beneficiary or invited reliance can create duty to a nonclient."
  },
  {
    question:
      "Drafting a trust: lawyer negligently drafts, causing unnecessary tax that reduces beneficiary’s payout. Beneficiary’s claim?",
    options: [
      "A. No claim because beneficiary wasn’t the lawyer’s client",
      "B. Likely claim because beneficiary was intended to benefit and harm was foreseeable",
      "C. No claim because taxes are unpredictable",
      "D. Claim only if lawyer promised beneficiary personally"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:

    options: [
      "A. Defendant has a negligence claim because the lawyer caused trouble/expense",
      "B. Defendant generally has no negligence claim because defendant was not an intended beneficiary and wasn’t invited to rely",
      "C. Defendant always has a claim because litigation is costly",
      "D. Defendant has a claim only if the lawyer is uninsured"
