    const questions = [
           {
        question: "In the \"any tax = rate × base\" framework, which of the following is a correct comparison of tax bases?",
        options: [
          "A. An income tax base taxes only wage earners while a consumption tax base taxes only investors",
          "B. An income tax base generally reaches both labor and capital income, while a consumption tax base focuses on what is spent, and a wealth tax base focuses on the stock of assets held at a point in time",
          "C. Income, consumption, and wealth tax bases are interchangeable and have no distributional or timing differences",
          "D. A wealth tax base is simply an income tax with a higher rate"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Under the rate × base identity, the choice of base matters. Income taxes target flows of labor and capital income; consumption taxes target what is spent; wealth taxes target the stock of assets. Those choices change who pays and when."
      },
      {
        question: "Which of the following best captures the contrast between positive and normative tax policy analysis?",
        options: [
          "A. Positive analysis asks whether a tax is constitutional; normative analysis asks whether it is administrable",
          "B. Positive analysis asks what the law should be; normative analysis asks what the law is",
          "C. Positive analysis focuses on describing distributional effects, behavioral responses, and administrative feasibility, while normative analysis asks whether those outcomes are fair or desirable",
          "D. There is no meaningful distinction between positive and normative analysis in tax"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Positive analysis is descriptive: who bears the tax, how behavior changes, and how the system is administered. Normative analysis evaluates whether those outcomes are fair, efficient, or otherwise desirable."
      },
      {
        question: "Which of the following is NOT a standard way the government could deliver a $1,000 subsidy to college students?",
        options: [
          "A. A refundable income tax credit",
          "B. A direct spending grant administered by an agency",
          "C. A regulation requiring universities to cut tuition by $1,000 per student",
          "D. A constitutional amendment prohibiting tuition above a certain level"
        ],
        correct: 3,
        explanation: "Refundable credits, direct grants, and regulatory mandates can all deliver similar economic support. A constitutional amendment setting tuition caps is not a standard policy instrument and is qualitatively different from ordinary delivery mechanisms."
      },
      {
        question: "Which pair of definitions most accurately describes horizontal and vertical equity in tax design?",
        options: [
          "A. Horizontal: treat rich and poor differently; Vertical: treat rich and poor the same",
          "B. Horizontal: equal treatment of those with equal ability to pay; Vertical: higher burdens on those with greater ability to pay",
          "C. Horizontal: focusing on efficiency; Vertical: focusing on administration",
          "D. Horizontal: taxing only labor; Vertical: taxing only capital"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Horizontal equity is equal treatment of equals (same ability to pay). Vertical equity is differential treatment of unequals, often implemented via progressive rate structures or targeted benefits."
      },
      {
        question: "Which of the following tradeoffs BEST describes the tension between progressivity, efficiency, and revenue sufficiency?",
        options: [
          "A. More progressivity always increases total revenue with no efficiency cost",
          "B. Highly progressive systems may create larger behavioral distortions, potentially shrinking the tax base and complicating revenue sufficiency goals",
          "C. Revenue sufficiency is unrelated to the shape of the rate schedule",
          "D. Efficiency concerns arise only under regressive tax systems"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "More progressivity may improve vertical equity but can increase behavioral responses (e.g., reduced labor supply, more avoidance) and thus affect efficiency and overall revenue raised."
      },
      {
        question: "How does a uniform head (poll) tax score on horizontal and vertical equity?",
        options: [
          "A. Strong horizontal equity and strong vertical equity",
          "B. Weak horizontal equity and strong vertical equity",
          "C. Strong horizontal equity (everyone pays the same amount) but poor vertical equity (burden is heavier on the poor)",
          "D. Weak horizontal equity but strong efficiency"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "A head tax charges everyone the same dollar amount, which looks horizontally equal but is vertically regressive because that flat amount is a much larger share of a poor person’s income."
      },
      {
        question: "Which statement best summarizes the roles of Congress, Treasury/IRS, and the courts in tax law?",
        options: [
          "A. Congress administers the Code, Treasury writes statutes, courts enforce political norms",
          "B. Congress enacts statutes, Treasury/IRS issues regulations and guidance to implement them, and courts interpret and apply these rules in disputes",
          "C. Treasury enacts the Internal Revenue Code, Congress issues regulations, and courts handle collections",
          "D. Courts write tax regulations and Congress reviews them every year"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Congress enacts the Internal Revenue Code; Treasury and the IRS issue regulations, rulings, and other guidance; courts interpret those authorities in litigation between taxpayers and the government."
      },
      {
        question: "Which of the following correctly distinguishes Tax Court from a federal district court for a federal tax dispute?",
        options: [
          "A. Tax Court requires prepayment of tax; district court does not",
          "B. Tax Court does not require prepayment of the disputed deficiency; district court generally requires full payment and then a refund suit",
          "C. Both forums always provide jury trials",
          "D. Appeals from both go only to the Federal Circuit"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Tax Court is a prepayment forum; you can litigate without first paying the deficiency. District court generally requires full payment followed by a refund claim. District courts can provide jury trials; Tax Court does not."
      },
      {
        question: "Why are third-party information reports (like Forms W-2 and 1099) crucial to the functioning of the income tax?",
        options: [
          "A. They reduce the need for taxpayers to file returns",
          "B. They give the IRS independent data to verify taxpayer reports, increasing compliance and allowing targeted audits",
          "C. They are required only for high-income taxpayers",
          "D. They eliminate the need for withholding"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Third-party reports create cross-checking: when payors report wages or interest, the IRS can match that data to returns, which greatly increases compliance and shapes where audit resources are focused."
      },
      {
        question: "Which of the following best captures the contrast between the Haig–Simons and § 61 approaches to defining income?",
        options: [
          "A. Haig–Simons focuses on realized gains only; § 61 includes unrealized appreciation",
          "B. Haig–Simons defines income conceptually as consumption plus change in net wealth, while § 61 uses a sources-based list of specific types of accessions to wealth",
          "C. Haig–Simons is used only for corporations; § 61 is used only for individuals",
          "D. Haig–Simons is an accounting concept; § 61 is an economic concept"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Haig–Simons is a conceptual, uses-based definition (C + ΔS). Section 61 is a statutory, sources-based list (compensation, business income, interest, rents, etc.) used in positive law."
      },
      {
        question: "Which of the following best states the lesson of Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner about \"who has income\"?",
        options: [
          "A. The person who writes the check to the IRS always has the income",
          "B. Employer-paid taxes are deductible by the employee",
          "C. When an employer pays an employee's tax liability, the economic benefit is income to the employee, even though the employer remits the tax",
          "D. Taxes paid on behalf of an employee are excluded under § 132"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Old Colony treats the employer's payment of Wood's income tax as additional compensation to Wood. Economic benefit and payor’s motive (compensation) determine who has the income."
      },
      {
        question: "Why does the Old Colony \"gross-up\" logic imply that Wood's pre-tax salary must be higher than the desired after-tax amount?",
        options: [
          "A. Because employers cannot deduct wages for income tax purposes",
          "B. Because paying an employee's tax increases the employee's income, which itself is taxed, requiring a higher face salary to net the same after-tax amount",
          "C. Because the IRS requires a 50% surcharge on all gross-ups",
          "D. Because statutory incidence cannot be shifted"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Once the employer-paid tax is itself taxable compensation, you have to solve for a salary S such that S minus tax(S) yields the desired net. This typically requires S to exceed the target net amount, creating the gross-up."
      },
      {
        question: "Which of the following best defines a \"tax expenditure\"?",
        options: [
          "A. Any government audit",
          "B. Any item in the Code that increases gross income",
          "C. A deviation from a chosen baseline tax system (e.g., exclusion, deduction, credit, preferential rate) that operates like spending through the tax code",
          "D. The IRS’s annual budget"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Tax expenditures are tax-code provisions that reduce liability relative to a normative baseline income tax and function like spending programs delivered through the tax system."
      },
      {
        question: "Why do deductions often create \"upside-down\" subsidies compared with refundable credits?",
        options: [
          "A. Deductions are only available to low-income taxpayers",
          "B. The value of a deduction rises with the taxpayer's marginal rate, so higher-bracket taxpayers get larger dollar benefits than lower-bracket taxpayers for the same deduction amount",
          "C. Credits are always smaller than deductions",
          "D. Deductions are refundable; credits are not"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Because deductions reduce taxable income, their value equals the deduction amount times the marginal tax rate. High-bracket taxpayers therefore get more benefit from the same deduction than low-bracket taxpayers."
      },
      {
        question: "Which of the following best describes the difference between refundable and nonrefundable credits?",
        options: [
          "A. Nonrefundable credits can exceed tax liability; refundable credits cannot",
          "B. Refundable credits can generate a refund even when tax liability is zero; nonrefundable credits are limited to reducing liability to zero",
          "C. Refundable credits are only for corporations; nonrefundable only for individuals",
          "D. There is no practical difference"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "A refundable credit can exceed tentative tax and generate a net payment to the taxpayer. A nonrefundable credit can only reduce tax liability down to zero; any excess is generally lost or carried forward subject to rules."
      },
      {
        question: "Which statement best captures why § 61 is your default starting point for fringe benefits?",
        options: [
          "A. Section 61 excludes all noncash benefits",
          "B. Section 61 includes all accessions to wealth unless a specific Code provision excludes them, so most fringe benefits are income unless an exclusion like § 119 or § 132 applies",
          "C. Section 61 applies only to cash compensation",
          "D. Fringe benefits are governed exclusively by state law"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Section 61 defines gross income broadly. You start from inclusion and then look for specific exclusions for meals, lodging, or fringes. Without an exclusion, a fringe is usually taxable compensation."
      },
      {
        question: "Which of the following best summarizes Duberstein’s contribution to the definition of a \"gift\" under § 102?",
        options: [
          "A. Gifts are any transfers between family members",
          "B. A gift turns entirely on the labels the parties use",
          "C. A \"gift\" depends on the transferor's dominant motive of detached and disinterested generosity, judged by an objective evaluation of all the facts and circumstances",
          "D. Any transfer under $25 is automatically a gift"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Duberstein emphasizes that gifts must spring from detached and disinterested generosity, not compensation or business motives, and that courts must look to objective facts rather than the parties’ labels."
      },
      {
        question: "Why is § 1014 particularly valuable for very wealthy taxpayers using \"buy, borrow, die\"?",
        options: [
          "A. It allows them to deduct all personal consumption",
          "B. It steps up basis of appreciated assets to fair market value at death, effectively wiping out income tax on accrued but unrealized gains",
          "C. It permits unlimited loss carrybacks",
          "D. It exempts all dividend income from tax"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Section 1014 gives a FMV basis at death, eliminating income tax on lifetime appreciation if assets are held until death. Combined with realization and preferential capital gains, this is central to the buy–borrow–die strategy."
      },
      {
        question: "Which of the following best explains why realization matters for the timing of income tax liability?",
        options: [
          "A. Realization creates economic gain that did not exist before",
          "B. Realization allows the IRS to ignore changes in value",
          "C. Realization determines when existing economic gain is taken into account; deferring realization defers tax and thus lowers its present value",
          "D. Realization applies only to wage income"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Realization events (like sales or exchanges) are the trigger for recognizing many gains. Delaying realization pushes tax payments into the future, which is valuable because of the time value of money."
      },
      {
        question: "Which of the following best describes the holding of Cesarini regarding treasure trove?",
        options: [
          "A. Treasure trove is never taxable under § 61",
          "B. Treasure trove is taxable as gross income when reduced to undisputed possession, generally in the year discovered",
          "C. Treasure trove is taxed only when sold",
          "D. Treasure trove is always excluded as a gift"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Cesarini holds that found cash is gross income under § 61 when the taxpayer reduces it to undisputed possession, typically in the year of discovery."
      },
      {
        question: "Which of the following best explains the constitutional concern in Eisner v. Macomber?",
        options: [
          "A. Whether Congress could tax gifts",
          "B. Whether a pro rata stock dividend constituted \"income\" under the 16th Amendment or was merely a rearrangement of capital",
          "C. Whether realization was required for any tax",
          "D. Whether corporate distributions were deductible"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Macomber asked whether a stock dividend was income or simply a capitalization of earnings. The Court treated it as not income for 16th Amendment purposes, raising questions about realization as a constitutional requirement."
      },
      {
        question: "Which of the following best states the basic rule of § 108(e)(5) (purchase price adjustment)?",
        options: [
          "A. It treats all COD as tax-free",
          "B. It recharacterizes certain reductions of purchase-money debt owed to the seller, when the buyer is solvent and still owns the property, as a reduction in purchase price rather than COD income, thereby reducing basis",
          "C. It converts capital gains into ordinary income",
          "D. It applies only in bankruptcy"

          "D. Because depreciation schedules are simpler than current deductions"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Capitalization aligns cost recovery with the period over which an asset produces income. Immediate expensing of long-lived investments would tilt the system toward consumption taxation."

          "A. Tax is imposed each year on all changes in wealth, realized or not",

          "A. Tax is only due at the moment of sale",
          "B. Tax is due only when dividends are paid",

        ],
        correct: 1,

          "D. Complexity of computing basis"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Realization-based taxation encourages investors to hold onto appreciated assets to avoid triggering tax (‘lock-in’). Mark-to-market taxes gains as they accrue, reducing the incentive to defer sales for tax reasons."

        options: [

          "B. Many assets are hard to value annually and may not generate cash flow to pay the tax",

          "D. It can only be applied to wage income"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Mark-to-market raises serious valuation and liquidity problems for nontraded or illiquid assets (closely held businesses, real estate, art), because values are hard to measure yearly and taxpayers may not have cash to pay the tax."

        question: "In a realization-based system, why does deferral of tax on unsold appreciated assets create an advantage relative to mark-to-market?",
        options: [
          "A. Because the tax rate is always lower under realization",
          "B. Because deferral allows the taxpayer to earn a return on money that would otherwise already have been paid in tax, effectively lowering the present value of the tax burden",
          "C. Because deferral guarantees that gain will never be taxed",
          "D. Because realization taxes are not legally enforceable"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Deferral lets the taxpayer invest the government’s implicit share of the gain until realization. The present value of tax is lower when payment is postponed, all else equal, given positive interest rates."

          "D. Including employer-paid taxes as income to the employee"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Haig–Simons would conceptually include unrealized gains. Deferring tax until realization is a departure from that ideal, driven by administrative and political considerations."

          "A. Taxpayers are locked out of capital markets",
          "B. Taxpayers are locked into underreporting wage income",

          "D. Taxpayers are locked into their current tax bracket"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Because tax is triggered by realization, investors may hold onto appreciated assets longer than is economically optimal to avoid or delay paying tax, distorting portfolio decisions."
