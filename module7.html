// Module 7 — Transactions and Communications With Persons Other Than Clients

const questions = [
  // A) Truthfulness in Statements to Third Persons — Rule 4.1
  {
    question: "Rule 4.1(a): When dealing on behalf of a client with a third person, a lawyer must not knowingly:",
    options: [
      "A. Fail to volunteer all relevant facts",
      "B. Make a false statement of material fact or law",
      "C. Make any statement that helps the client",
      "D. Use negotiation tactics that include puffery"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Rule 4.1(a) forbids knowing false statements of material fact or law; there is generally no duty to volunteer facts."
  },
  {
    question: "Under Rule 4.1, a lawyer generally has:",
    options: [
      "A. A duty to disclose all relevant facts to third persons",
      "B. No duty to inform a third person of relevant facts, but must not misrepresent facts",
      "C. A duty to disclose all weaknesses in the client’s case",
      "D. A duty to correct every misunderstanding of the other side"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "No general duty to disclose facts, but you can’t misrepresent—by words, half-truths, or (sometimes) silence."
  },
  {
    question: "Which is a recognized type of misrepresentation under Rule 4.1 cmt. 1?",
    options: [
      "A. A statement that is technically true but misleading in context",
      "B. Silence, but only when a statute explicitly requires disclosure",
      "C. Any optimistic statement about litigation outcomes",
      "D. Any refusal to answer a question in negotiations"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Misrepresentation includes false statements, adopting false statements, half-truths, and in some contexts silence."
  },
  {
    question: "Seller’s lawyer knows soil is unsuitable for walnuts. Buyer says: “I assume this is good for a walnut orchard.” Seller replies vaguely: “You’d be surprised what can grow here.” Lawyer stays silent. Result:",
    options: [
      "A. Proper—no duty to volunteer facts",
      "B. Improper—silence in this context is equivalent to an affirmative misrepresentation",
      "C. Proper—buyer should do their own diligence",
      "D. Proper—statements about agriculture are never “material”"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Context makes the silence misleading; Rule 4.1 can treat it as misrepresentation."
  },
  {
    question: "During settlement talks, plaintiff dies. Plaintiff’s lawyer continues negotiating without disclosing the death. Under the outline:",
    options: [
      "A. Permissible because death is confidential client information",
      "B. Not permitted—lawyer must disclose the death and cannot negotiate as if client were alive",
      "C. Permissible if lawyer has authority from the estate",
      "D. Permissible if defense never asks"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Continuing negotiations without revealing the death is a misrepresentation."
  },
  {
    question: "Which statement is MOST likely treated as permissible “puffery” (not a statement of material fact) under Rule 4.1 cmt. 2?",
    options: [
      "A. “My client never signed the contract.”",
      "B. “We have a key witness who will testify X.”",
      "C. “I doubt my client will be interested in settling; we think we can win at trial.”",
      "D. “The product has never failed safety testing.”"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Negotiation conventions treat some value/settlement-intentions talk as puffery; concrete factual claims are different."
  },
  {
    question: "Which is LEAST likely to be protected as “puffery” under Rule 4.1?",
    options: [
      "A. A party’s estimate of a property’s value",
      "B. A statement of settlement intentions",
      "C. A knowingly false statement that a material permit has been approved",
      "D. A prediction that the case will settle quickly"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Puffery doesn’t cover knowing lies about material facts (e.g., permit approval/denial)."
  },
  {
    question: "Rule 4.1(b): A lawyer must disclose material facts to a third person when necessary to avoid assisting a client’s crime or fraud—unless:",
    options: [
      "A. The client insists on secrecy",
      "B. The lawyer would prefer to withdraw instead",
      "C. Disclosure is forbidden by the duty of confidentiality",
      "D. The third person is sophisticated"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "If confidentiality forbids disclosure and continued representation would assist fraud, the ABA approach is withdrawal."
  },
  {
    question: "Client privately tells lawyer a key license has been denied, but lawyer previously provided a statement/opinion implying approval was likely. Client demands lawyer keep pushing the sale without telling buyer. Under the ABA Model Rules approach in the outline, the lawyer should:",
    options: [
      "A. Continue and say nothing—no duty to disclose",
      "B. Disclose the denial to the buyer even if confidential",
      "C. Withdraw (and may notify buyer of withdrawal and disaffirm prior opinion/document), because continuing would assist fraud",
      "D. Stay on the case but “hint” at problems without specifics"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "ABA approach: confidentiality may block direct disclosure; if continued work would assist fraud → withdraw, and may disaffirm prior work."
  },
  {
    question: "After withdrawing to avoid assisting client fraud, the lawyer may:",
    options: [
      "A. Tell the third party all confidential details of the fraud",
      "B. Notify the third party of the withdrawal and withdraw/disaffirm prior opinions/documents previously furnished",
      "C. Stay silent forever and take no remedial steps",
      "D. Demand the third party sign an NDA"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "ABA approach permits notice of withdrawal and disaffirmance of prior statements without spilling all confidences."
  },
  {
    question: "Restatement vs ABA on disclosure to avoid client fraud (as summarized in the outline):",
    options: [
      "A. Restatement is more forthright: if fraud law requires disclosure, the information is not protected by confidentiality and must be disclosed",
      "B. Restatement always forbids disclosure to third parties",
      "C. ABA requires disclosure in all fraud situations no matter what",
      "D. Both take identical approaches"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Outline: Restatement treats required fraud disclosures as not protected by confidentiality; ABA approach often pushes toward withdrawal."
  },

  // B) Communication with Persons Represented by Counsel — Rule 4.2
  {
    question: "Rule 4.2: A lawyer must not communicate about the matter with a person the lawyer knows is represented by counsel unless:",
    options: [
      "A. The represented person initiates the contact",
      "B. The represented person consents",
      "C. The person’s counsel consents (expressly or impliedly), or law/court order authorizes the contact",
      "D. The lawyer labels the communication “informational only”"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Even if the represented person initiates/consents, Rule 4.2 requires counsel consent or legal authorization."
  },
  {
    question: "Defense counsel suspects plaintiff’s lawyer never conveyed a settlement offer, so defense counsel calls the represented plaintiff directly to convey the offer. Result:",
    options: [
      "A. Proper because it protects the plaintiff",
      "B. Improper—communication with a represented person without counsel consent violates Rule 4.2",
      "C. Proper if the offer is below policy limits",
      "D. Proper if defense counsel documents the call"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Rule 4.2 violation even if plaintiff’s counsel is behaving badly."
  },
  {
    question: "A prosecutor visits an indicted defendant in jail to discuss a plea bargain without the defendant’s appointed counsel consenting. Under Rule 4.2:",
    options: [
      "A. Permitted because prosecutors are exempt",
      "B. Permitted if defendant wants to talk",
      "C. Prohibited; prosecutor is subject to discipline",
      "D. Permitted if no Miranda issues"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Rule 4.2 applies; counsel consent (or lawful authorization) is required."
  },
  {
    question: "Rule 4.2 applies to communications that:",
    options: [
      "A. Concern the subject of the representation",
      "B. Concern any topic, including the weather",
      "C. Are only written, not oral",
      "D. Occur only in court"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "The key is communication about the matter."
  },
  {
    question: "Which is NOT prohibited by Rule 4.2 (as described in the outline)?",
    options: [
      "A. A lawyer interviewing an unrepresented person who will be a witness for another party",
      "B. A lawyer negotiating directly with a represented opposing party about the matter",
      "C. A prosecutor discussing plea terms with a represented defendant without counsel consent",
      "D. A defense lawyer calling the represented plaintiff directly about settlement without counsel consent"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Rule 4.2 doesn’t bar interviewing unrepresented witnesses; it bars lawyer-to-represented-person about the matter."
  },
  {
    question: "Direct communication between represented persons themselves (party-to-party) is:",
    options: [
      "A. Always prohibited by Rule 4.2",
      "B. Not prohibited by Rule 4.2 (the rule restricts lawyers, not the represented parties talking to each other)",
      "C. Prohibited unless both lawyers are present",
      "D. Prohibited only in criminal cases"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Rule 4.2 targets lawyers’ communications with represented persons."
  },

  // Rule 4.2 and organizations
  {
    question: "For an organization, Rule 4.2 generally requires consent of the organization’s counsel before communicating with which constituent?",
    options: [
      "A. Any employee, even a janitor with no knowledge",
      "B. Anyone who supervises/directs/regularly consults with org counsel about the matter, whose conduct may be imputed for liability, or who can obligate the org on the matter",
      "C. Any former employee",
      "D. Any shareholder"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Rule 4.2 covers key constituents tied to counsel, liability, or authority to bind the org."
  },
  {
    question: "If a current employee is represented by their own lawyer in the matter, consent to communicate can come from:",
    options: [
      "A. Only the organization’s lawyer",
      "B. Only the employee’s personal lawyer",
      "C. Either the organization’s lawyer or the employee’s personal lawyer",
      "D. No one—communication is never allowed"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Outline: if the constituent has their own counsel in the matter, that counsel’s consent is sufficient."
  },
  {
    question: "Rule 4.2 and former constituents of an organization:",
    options: [
      "A. Consent is required to speak with any former employee",
      "B. Consent is not needed to speak with former constituents, but lawyer must avoid intruding on privilege/other rights",
      "C. Former employees are never allowed to speak",
      "D. Former employees may be contacted only if the org’s counsel is copied on emails"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "You may contact former constituents, but must not pry into privileged communications."
  },
  {
    question: "Plaintiff’s lawyer interviews a newspaper’s former editor and induces disclosure of privileged communications between the editor and the newspaper’s counsel about the case. This is best characterized as:",
    options: [
      "A. Proper because the editor is a former employee",
      "B. Improper because the lawyer is prying into privileged communications / violating third-party rights",
      "C. Proper if the editor volunteers the info",
      "D. Required by zealous representation"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Even if Rule 4.2 consent isn’t required for former employees, privilege must be respected (Rule 4.4 concerns too)."
  },

  // Reply-all implied consent + pro se lawyer exception
  {
    question: "Email “Reply All” scenario: Lawyer L emails opposing counsel A and copies L’s client C. Absent contrary instruction, L has:",
    options: [
      "A. Expressly forbidden any reply",
      "B. Impliedly consented to A using “Reply All” and thus communicating directly with C",
      "C. Waived C’s privilege automatically",
      "D. Committed a Rule 4.2 violation"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Outline: copying your client can imply consent for a reply-all; better practice is forwarding separately."
  },
  {
    question: "Lawyer acting pro se (representing themself) wants to contact an opposing party who is represented. Under the outline’s rule:",
    options: [
      "A. Allowed because the lawyer is a party, not a lawyer",
      "B. Prohibited—pro se lawyer is treated as a lawyer representing a client (themself) and is subject to Rule 4.2",
      "C. Allowed only by phone, not email",
      "D. Allowed if the pro se lawyer says “not legal advice”"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "A lawyer pro se is still a lawyer for Rule 4.2 purposes."
  },

  // C) Dealing with Unrepresented Persons — Rule 4.3
  {
    question: "Rule 4.3: When dealing with an unrepresented person, a lawyer must not:",
    options: [
      "A. Negotiate with them",
      "B. State or imply that the lawyer is disinterested",
      "C. Ask them questions",
      "D. Provide any documents"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "You must make clear you represent your client, not the unrepresented person."
  },
  {
    question: "If an unrepresented person misunderstands the lawyer’s role, Rule 4.3 requires the lawyer to:",
    options: [
      "A. Use the misunderstanding as leverage",
      "B. Make reasonable efforts to correct the misunderstanding",
      "C. End all communications permanently",
      "D. Give legal advice to build trust"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "You must correct role confusion."

  {
    question: "If the lawyer knows (or should know) the unrepresented person’s interests likely conflict with the client’s interests, the lawyer must not give the unrepresented person:",

      "C. A copy of the draft agreement",
      "D. A summary of the client’s demands"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "You may negotiate, but you can’t advise the unrepresented person on what’s best for them (beyond “get a lawyer”)."
  },
  {
    question: "Landlord’s lawyer negotiates a lease with an unrepresented tenant. Which is MOST consistent with Rule 4.3?",
    options: [
      "A. “I represent both of you, but I’ll be fair.”",
      "B. “I represent the landlord, not you. I can tell you what terms my client will accept.”",

      "D. “Sign this now or you’ll lose everything—trust me.”"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Clear role disclosure is required; negotiation itself is allowed."
  },
  {
    question: "Under Rule 4.3, the lawyer may draft a proposed agreement for the unrepresented person to review and may explain:",
    options: [
      "A. Only the client’s benefits, never the legal effect",
      "B. What the lawyer believes the legal effect of the agreement will be, while still avoiding legal advice to the unrepresented person beyond “get a lawyer”",
      "C. That the lawyer is neutral and disinterested",
      "D. That the unrepresented person should accept because it’s “best”"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Explaining terms/effects can be okay; advising them what they should do (when interests conflict) is not."
  },
  {
    question: "Which is MOST likely impermissible legal advice to an unrepresented opposing party in a dispute (assuming interests conflict)?",
    options: [
      "A. “My client will accept $20,000.”",
      "B. “You should definitely sign this release; it’s the best deal you’ll ever get.”",
      "C. “I represent the other side; you may want to consult a lawyer.”",
      "D. “Here’s a copy of the draft settlement agreement.”"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Telling them what they should do is legal advice in a conflicting-interest setting."
  },

  // D) Respect for Rights of Third Persons — Rule 4.4
  {
    question: "Rule 4.4(a): In representing a client, a lawyer must not use means that have no substantial purpose other than to:",

      "C. Preserve evidence",
      "D. Seek admissible impeachment"
    ],
    correct: 1,

  {
    question: "Cross-examining a witness with irrelevant, inadmissible prostitution convictions solely to humiliate them is:",
    options: [
