    const questions = [
    {
    question: "Which of the following is NOT a requirement for an amendment to a pleading to relate back to the date of the original pleading when changing the naming of a party?",
    options: [
      "A. The claim against the newly named defendant must have arisen from the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence as the original pleading.",
      "B. The newly named party must have known, or should have known, that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party's identity, within the period provided by Rule 4(m).",
      "C. The newly named party's attorney must have been served with a copy of the original complaint within the period provided by Rule 4(m).",
      "D. The newly named party must have received such notice of the institution of the action that it will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, within the period provided by Rule 4(m)."
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Options A, B, and D are all requirements for an amendment to relate back when changing the naming of a party under FRCP 15(c)(1)(C). Option C is not a requirement for relation back. While the 'shared attorney' constructive notice method can satisfy the notice requirement, serving the new party's attorney is not a requirement under the rule."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the primary difference between a compulsory counterclaim and a permissive counterclaim under FRCP 13?",
    options: [
      "A. A compulsory counterclaim must be brought in the same action as the original claim, while a permissive counterclaim may be brought in a separate action.",
      "B. A compulsory counterclaim is only available to defendants, while a permissive counterclaim may be brought by either party.",
      "C. A compulsory counterclaim must be related to the original claim, while a permissive counterclaim may be unrelated.",
      "D. A compulsory counterclaim is subject to a higher pleading standard than a permissive counterclaim."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "The key distinction between a compulsory counterclaim and a permissive counterclaim lies in the requirement that a compulsory counterclaim must be raised in the same action or be forever barred. A permissive counterclaim, on the other hand, can be brought in a separate action. Options B, C, and D are incorrect. Both compulsory and permissive counterclaims can be brought by defendants, must be related to the original claim, and are subject to the same pleading standards."
  },
  {
    question: "Under FRCP 14, when can a defendant implead a third party?",
    options: [
      "A. When the third party is solely liable to the plaintiff.",
      "B. When the third party is or may be liable to the defendant for all or part of the claim against the defendant.",
      "C. When the third party has a claim against the plaintiff arising out of the same transaction or occurrence.",
      "D. When the third party has a claim against the defendant unrelated to the plaintiff’s claim."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "FRCP 14 allows a defending party to implead a third party who is or may be liable to the defendant for all or part of the plaintiff's claim. Option A is incorrect because it does not satisfy the impleader rule requirement of liability between the third-party defendant and the defendant. Option C is incorrect because it does not satisfy the 'for all or part of' requirement, and Option D describes a scenario where the defendant is attempting to assert an independent claim, which is not allowed under Rule 14."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following accurately describes the “plausibility” pleading standard established in Bell Atlantic v. Twombly?",
    options: [
      "A. A complaint must provide a detailed account of all relevant facts, including dates, times, and specific actions.",
      "B. A complaint must allege sufficient facts, taken as true, to state a claim for relief that is plausible, not merely possible or conceivable, on its face.",
      "C. A complaint must include the legal theories and elements of each cause of action.",
      "D. A complaint must anticipate and respond to potential defenses the defendant may raise."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The 'plausibility' standard requires complaints to allege enough facts to make the claim plausible on its face, not merely possible. Conclusory allegations are insufficient. This differs from a 'fact pleading' standard requiring a detailed account of every fact. While complaints must provide a short and plain statement of the claim, they do not need to explicitly state legal theories or elements. Additionally, while responding to potential defenses is part of the pleading process, it is not part of the plausibility standard."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a permissible ground for a court to grant a protective order under FRCP 26(c)?",
    options: [
      "A. To protect a party from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.",
      "B. To prevent a party from disclosing information that would be harmful to its reputation.",
      "C. To allow a party to delay discovery until it has had an opportunity to complete its own investigation.",
      "D. To compel a party to produce documents that are not relevant to the claims or defenses in the case."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "FRCP 26(c) allows the court to grant a protective order for good cause to protect a party from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. Options B, C, and D are incorrect. While a protective order might indirectly protect a party's reputation, delay discovery, or prevent the production of irrelevant documents, these are not the explicit grounds for granting a protective order under the rule. The focus is on protecting parties from unfair or burdensome discovery practices."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a key takeaway from Celotex Corp. v. Catrett?",
    options: [
      "A. The movant for summary judgment must always provide affirmative evidence to support the motion.",
      "B. The nonmovant for summary judgment must always provide evidence that would be admissible at trial.",
      "C. The movant for summary judgment can satisfy its initial burden by pointing out the absence of evidence supporting the nonmovant's case.",
      "D. The nonmovant for summary judgment only needs to provide a scintilla of evidence to defeat the motion."
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Celotex held that a movant can satisfy its initial burden for summary judgment by pointing to the lack of evidence supporting the nonmovant's case. This means the movant does not always need to provide affirmative evidence. The nonmovant, however, must provide more than a 'scintilla' of evidence; it must be enough to create a genuine dispute of material fact. The evidence also must be admissible at trial."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following accurately describes the two-part test used to determine the right to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment?",
    options: [
      "A. The court must consider the nature of the claim and the amount in controversy.",
      "B. The court must consider the complexity of the legal issues and the potential for jury bias.",
      "C. The court must compare the statutory action to 18th-century actions in England and examine the nature of the remedy sought.",
      "D. The court must consider the parties’ preference for a jury trial and the availability of a fair and impartial jury."
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "The Terry two-part test involves: 1) comparing the claim to 18th-century English actions and 2) examining whether the remedy sought is legal or equitable. The amount in controversy (Option A), while relevant to the Seventh Amendment's applicability, is not part of the two-part test. The complexity of legal issues and potential for bias (Option B) are factors courts might consider in managing a case but are not part of the Seventh Amendment analysis. While parties' preference for a jury trial is relevant to the demand and waiver of a jury trial (Option D), the Seventh Amendment analysis focuses on whether the right exists in the first place."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following scenarios is most likely to result in a court granting a motion for judgment as a matter of law under FRCP 50(a)?",
    options: [
      "A. The plaintiff presents credible testimony from a witness who observed the defendant’s negligent conduct.",
      "B. The defendant fails to appear for trial, and the plaintiff presents evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case.",
      "C. The plaintiff presents conflicting testimony from two witnesses regarding a key fact, and the defendant presents no evidence.",
      "D. The defendant admits liability, but the parties disagree about the amount of damages."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "A motion for judgment as a matter of law is appropriate when there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the non-moving party. Option B presents a scenario where the defendant has not contested the plaintiff's case, and the plaintiff has presented a prima facie case, making it highly likely the court would grant the motion. Options A, C, and D all present situations where there is evidence, or a lack thereof, that could lead a reasonable jury to different conclusions, making a judgment as a matter of law unlikely."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is NOT a factor a court should consider when determining whether to grant leave to amend a pleading under FRCP 15(a)(2)?",
    options: [
      "A. The stage of the litigation.",
      "B. Whether the amendment would cause prejudice to the opposing party.",
      "C. Whether the amendment is brought in good faith.",
      "D. Whether the amendment would add a new legal theory to the case."
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "FRCP 15(a)(2) allows a party to amend a pleading with the court's leave, which should be freely given when justice so requires. Courts consider various factors when deciding whether to grant leave, including the stage of the litigation, potential prejudice to the opposing party, and good faith. However, adding a new legal theory is not inherently a reason to deny leave. Parties are allowed to develop their legal arguments throughout the litigation, and amendments can help facilitate a full and fair adjudication of the dispute."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the primary reason for the “ascertainability” requirement in class action certification?",
    options: [
      "A. To ensure that all class members have suffered the same injury.",
      "B. To ensure that the class representatives have standing to sue.",
      "C. To ensure that the class action is manageable and efficient.",
      "D. To ensure that the class members are adequately represented."
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "The 'ascertainability' requirement ensures that the class is clearly defined and its members identifiable. This promotes manageability and efficiency in the class action, as it allows for proper notice to class members and helps the court determine who is bound by the judgment. While ascertainability might indirectly relate to the other options, its primary purpose is to define the class clearly, which aids in managing the litigation."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is an advantage of the German civil procedure system, as highlighted by Langbein in 'The German Advantage in Civil Procedure'?",
    options: [
      "A. More active role of the judge in shaping the litigation.",
      "B. Greater reliance on juries to decide factual disputes.",
      "C. Adversarial discovery process that encourages parties to gather all relevant evidence.",
      "D. Strict pleading standards that require detailed factual allegations in the complaint."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Langbein argues that the German system's strength lies in the judge's active role in managing the case, gathering evidence, and shaping the litigation. This contrasts with the American system, which emphasizes party-driven discovery and, according to Langbein, can lead to procedural complexities and inequities, particularly when parties have unequal resources. The German system does not rely on juries in civil cases, and its pleading standards are not as strict as in the American system, making Options B, C, and D incorrect."
  },
  {
    question: "What was the holding in Hensley v. Eckerhart regarding the calculation of attorney's fees in fee-shifting cases?",
    options: [
      "A. The court must award the attorney the full amount of their privately contracted contingency fee.",
      "B. The court should use a 'lodestar' calculation, which considers the reasonable number of hours worked and a reasonable hourly rate.",
      "C. The court should award a percentage of the damages awarded to the plaintiff.",
      "D. The court should consider the complexity of the legal issues and the risk involved in representing the plaintiff."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Hensley v. Eckerhart established the 'lodestar' method for calculating attorney's fees in fee-shifting cases. This method, based on reasonable hours and rates, aims to ensure fair compensation for attorneys while preventing excessive fees. The court does not have to award the full contingency fee (Option A) or a percentage of the damages (Option C). While complexity and risk (Option D) can factor into the reasonableness analysis, they are not the primary basis for the calculation."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a permissible crossclaim under FRCP 13(g)?",
    options: [
      "A. Defendant 1 sues Defendant 2 for breach of an unrelated contract.",
      "B. Defendant 1 sues the Plaintiff for damages arising from the same accident.",
      "C. Defendant 1 sues Defendant 2 for contribution on the Plaintiff's negligence claim against Defendant 1.",
      "D. Defendant 1 sues a non-party who may be liable to the Plaintiff."
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "FRCP 13(g) allows a party to assert a crossclaim against a co-party only if the claim arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the original action or counterclaim, or relates to any property that is the subject matter of the original action. Option C is the only option that meets these requirements. Option A is incorrect because it involves an unrelated contract, not the same transaction or occurrence as the original claim. Option B is a counterclaim, not a crossclaim. Option D is an impleader claim under FRCP 14, not a crossclaim."
  },
  {
    question: "In Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, the Supreme Court:",
    options: [
      "A. Abandoned the 'notice pleading' standard in favor of 'fact pleading.'",
      "B. Introduced the 'plausibility' pleading standard, requiring factual allegations to plausibly suggest a claim for relief.",
      "C. Held that conclusory allegations in a complaint are entitled to the presumption of truth.",
      "D. Limited the use of discovery to prevent expensive and burdensome litigation."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The Supreme Court in Twombly introduced the 'plausibility' pleading standard, moving away from the more lenient 'notice pleading' standard. This new standard requires a complaint to present enough facts to make the claim plausible, not merely conceivable. While the Court didn't explicitly abandon 'notice pleading,' the plausibility standard represents a significant shift. Options C and D are incorrect. Conclusory allegations are no longer given a presumption of truth, and Twombly didn't explicitly limit discovery but aimed to address its potential burdens indirectly."
  },
  {
    question: "Under FRCP 41(b), an involuntary dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is:",
    options: [
      "A. Always without prejudice.",
      "B. Always with prejudice.",
      "C. Without prejudice, unless the court specifies otherwise.",
      "D. With prejudice, unless the court specifies otherwise."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "According to FRCP 41(b) and the holding in Lomax v. Ortiz-Marquez, an involuntary dismissal for failure to state a claim is considered with prejudice unless the court explicitly states otherwise. Option D is therefore incorrect. This default 'with prejudice' designation prevents a plaintiff from repeatedly filing the same claim after dismissal."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a key difference between a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss and a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment?",
    options: [
      "A. A 12(b)(6) motion is decided before any discovery, while a Rule 56 motion is decided after discovery is complete.",
      "B. A 12(b)(6) motion challenges the legal sufficiency of the complaint, while a Rule 56 motion challenges the factual sufficiency of the evidence.",
      "C. A 12(b)(6) motion can be filed by either party, while a Rule 56 motion can only be filed by the defendant.",
      "D. A 12(b)(6) motion is decided by the judge, while a Rule 56 motion is decided by a jury."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "The key difference is the timing and the scope of the court's review. A 12(b)(6) motion is filed before discovery and solely considers the allegations in the complaint. In contrast, a Rule 56 motion is typically filed after discovery and allows the court to examine evidence beyond the pleadings, such as affidavits and depositions. Option B is partially accurate but doesn't capture the full distinction. Both motions address legal and factual sufficiency, but the 56 motion examines the evidence supporting the facts, not just the allegations. Options C and D are incorrect. Both motions can be filed by either party and are decided by the judge."
  },
  {
    question: "A plaintiff files a complaint alleging breach of contract and negligence against a defendant. The defendant believes the plaintiff's negligence claim is legally insufficient. What is the defendant's best procedural option to challenge the negligence claim?",
    options: [
      "A. File a motion for summary judgment under FRCP 56.",
      "B. File a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under FRCP 12(b)(6).",
      "C. File a motion for judgment as a matter of law under FRCP 50(a).",
      "D. File an answer denying the allegations of negligence."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under FRCP 12(b)(6) is the proper procedural tool to challenge the legal sufficiency of a claim before discovery. It argues that even if all the facts alleged in the complaint are true, the plaintiff has not stated a claim recognized by law. In this scenario, the defendant believes the elements for negligence are not met, making a 12(b)(6) motion the appropriate choice. Option A, a motion for summary judgment under FRCP 56, is generally filed after discovery and is based on evidence, not just pleadings. Option C, a motion for judgment as a matter of law under FRCP 50(a), is made during trial when a party believes there is insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find in favor of the opposing party. Option D, filing an answer, is a necessary step in the litigation process, but it doesn't directly challenge the legal sufficiency of a claim."
  },
  {
    question: "In Singletary v. PA Dept. of Corrections, the plaintiff attempted to amend her complaint to add a doctor as a defendant after the statute of limitations had expired. The court denied the amendment because:",
    options: [
      "A. The amendment was not based on the same transaction or occurrence as the original pleading.",
      "B. The amendment was not made in good faith.",
      "C. The doctor did not have notice of the action within the time period required for relation back under FRCP 15(c)(1)(C).",
      "D. The plaintiff knew the doctor's identity at the time she filed the original complaint."
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "In Singletary, the court denied the plaintiff's motion to amend because the doctor did not receive notice of the lawsuit within the time period required for relation back under FRCP 15(c)(1)(C). Relation back allows an amended pleading to be treated as if it was filed on the date of the original pleading, even if the statute of limitations has run. However, this rule requires the new defendant to have received notice of the action within a specific timeframe (typically the period for service of process) to avoid prejudice. Because the doctor did not have timely notice, the court determined the amendment did not relate back and was therefore time-barred. Option A is incorrect because the claim against the doctor likely arose from the same events as the claims against the original defendants. Option B is incorrect because there's no indication of bad faith in the source. Option D is not a decisive factor under the relation back rule; the focus is on notice to the new defendant, not the plaintiff's knowledge."
  },
  {
    question: "The 'American Rule' regarding attorney's fees states that:",
    options: [
      "A. Each party generally bears their own attorney's fees, regardless of who wins the case.",
      "B. The prevailing party is always entitled to recover their attorney's fees from the losing party.",
      "C. The court can award attorney's fees to a party who has acted in bad faith.",
      "D. Attorney's fees are calculated using the 'lodestar' method, considering the reasonable number of hours worked and a reasonable hourly rate."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "The American Rule is a general principle in American litigation that each party is responsible for their own attorney's fees, win or lose. This contrasts with the 'English Rule,' which typically awards fees to the prevailing party. While there are exceptions to the American Rule, such as fee-shifting statutes or contractual provisions, it is the default rule in most cases. Option B describes the English Rule. Options C and D are partially accurate. Courts can award fees for bad faith conduct, and the lodestar method is used for calculating fees, but these are not the defining features of the American Rule itself."

    question: "Under FRCP 19(a), a party is considered 'necessary' to a lawsuit if:",
    options: [
      "A. That party could be sued by the plaintiff in a separate action.",
      "B. That party has a financial interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.",
      "C. In that party's absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among the existing parties.",
      "D. That party is a joint tortfeasor with one of the existing defendants."
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "FRCP 19(a) governs the required joinder of parties and states that a party must be joined if feasible and their absence would prevent the court from providing complete relief to the existing parties. Option C accurately reflects this rule. It focuses on the court's ability to fully resolve the dispute and provide an effective remedy. Option A is incorrect because the possibility of a separate lawsuit doesn't necessarily make a party 'necessary' under Rule 19. Option B is incorrect because a financial interest alone is not sufficient; the party's absence must hinder the court's ability to grant relief. Option D is incorrect; joint tortfeasors are generally not considered 'necessary' parties."

    question: "Which of the following is NOT a factor a court will consider when deciding whether to grant a motion for a protective order under FRCP 26(c)?",
    options: [
      "A. Whether the discovery sought is relevant to any party's claim or defense.",
      "B. Whether the discovery sought is proportional to the needs of the case.",
      "C. Whether the party seeking discovery has sufficient financial resources to conduct the requested discovery.",
      "D. Whether the discovery sought would cause annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense to the responding party."
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "FRCP 26(c) allows a court to issue a protective order to limit discovery if it would cause 'annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.' The rule focuses on protecting parties from overly broad or burdensome discovery requests. Options A, B, and D all reflect valid factors considered for a protective order, aligning with the rule's purpose. Option C, the financial resources of the party seeking discovery, is not a relevant factor under Rule 26(c). The rule's concern is the burden on the party responding to the discovery request, not the resources of the party making the request."

    question: "What is the purpose of a 'Markman hearing' in a patent infringement case?",
    options: [
      "A. To determine the amount of damages to be awarded to the prevailing party.",
      "B. To decide whether the patent is valid.",
      "C. To interpret the claims of the patent.",
      "D. To determine whether the defendant infringed the patent."
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "A Markman hearing is a pretrial hearing held in patent infringement cases specifically to resolve disputes over the meaning of the patent's claims. This interpretation of the claims is a matter of law decided by the judge, as established in Markman v. Westview. The judge's interpretation guides the jury's factual determination of infringement. Option A, damages, is typically addressed later in the trial. Option B, patent validity, might be a separate issue but isn't the focus of a Markman hearing. Option D, infringement, is a factual question for the jury, informed by the judge's claim interpretation."

  {
    question: "Which of the following statements accurately reflects the burden of production in a motion for summary judgment when the moving party bears the burden of persuasion at trial?",
    options: [
      "A. The moving party must demonstrate that the nonmoving party lacks evidence to support its claims.",
      "B. The moving party must produce enough evidence to show that no reasonable fact finder could rule against it on any of the elements at issue.",
      "C. The moving party need only point to the absence of evidence in the record to support the nonmoving party's claims.",
      "D. The moving party must prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "When the moving party in a summary judgment motion also has the burden of persuasion at trial, they face a higher burden of production. They must present sufficient evidence to effectively establish each element of their claim, so convincing that no reasonable jury could find against them. Option B accurately states this burden. This high standard ensures that summary judgment is only granted when the moving party's case is very strong. Option A reflects the burden when the movant doesn't have the burden of persuasion at trial. Option C is closer to the Celotex standard, where the movant merely points to the lack of evidence. Option D describes the burden of persuasion, not production, and applies at trial."

    question: "A defendant files a third-party complaint against a non-party, alleging that the non-party is liable to the defendant for all or part of the plaintiff's claims. This is known as:",
    options: [
      "A. A crossclaim.",
      "B. A counterclaim.",
      "C. An impleader claim.",
      "D. An intervention."
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Impleader under FRCP 14 is the correct term for a defendant bringing a third party into the lawsuit, claiming that the third party is liable to the defendant for all or part of the plaintiff's claims. This often involves claims for contribution or indemnity. Option A, a crossclaim, is a claim between co-parties, usually defendants. Option B, a counterclaim, is a claim by a defendant against the plaintiff. Option D, intervention, occurs when a non-party seeks to join the lawsuit on their own initiative."

    question: "Which of the following is NOT a requirement for a class action to be certified under FRCP 23(a)?",
    options: [
      "A. Numerosity: The class must be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.",
      "B. Commonality: There must be questions of law or fact common to the class.",
      "C. Typicality: The claims or defenses of the representative parties must be typical of those of the class.",
      "D. Predominance: Questions of law or fact common to class members must predominate over any questions affecting only individual members."
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "FRCP 23(a) outlines four prerequisites for class certification: numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation. Options A, B, and C accurately reflect these requirements. Option D, predominance, is a requirement for certain types of class actions under FRCP 23(b)(3), specifically those seeking monetary damages. It is not a prerequisite for class certification under Rule 23(a)."
